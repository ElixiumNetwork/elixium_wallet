# Elixium:
Elixium is a decentralized application network built for developers; its a Proof of Work blockchain that allows engineers to write programs that run on the chain. Right now, we're very early in our development phase, so it's a great time to get involved if you want to sway the direction of the project. We're completely open source and community driven, and we aim to continue being that way -- decentralized even within the development team. Check out the Contribution Guide to get started with contributing to Elixium. If you have any trouble getting set up or just want to join in with our development discussion, join our Telegram Group. The Elixium Development Wiki is a great place to get familiarized with Elixium's codebase.

### What we're aiming to solve

One of the biggest issues in the blockchain ecosystem right now is the high barrier to entry for engineers who want to use the technology, whether its to create a decentralized application or just to interface with the blockchain. This can be attributed to many different things, but the most pressing reason is that language support in the ecosystem is very poor. In order for an engineer to create a decentralized application or smart contract, they need to either learn a language that is specifically created for smart contracting or use a predetermined language that they might not already know. The fact of the matter is that learning a new language can take days or even weeks, and engineers are very excited about blockchain but don't want to invest weeks of their time learning a new toolset for a system that might not exist in a few years (e.g. learning Solidity to create Ethereum dApps), since the ecosystem is so rapidly evolving.

Elixium mitigates this barrier to entry by employing language agnostic smart contracts -- decentralized applications that can be written in potentially any language. Engineers will no longer be tied down to learning a new language like Solidity or migrating to a language like Javascript, they'll be able to use their existing toolset and create decentralized applications with any language that compiles to WebAssembly. They'll be able to use their C, C++, Python, Go, and any other language they're already familiar with -- all they have to do is learn a new API to interact with the chain.
